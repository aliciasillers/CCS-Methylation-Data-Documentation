# CCS Methylation Data Project Documentation

This repository is meant to be an unofficial set of documentation for everything related to obtaining DNA methylation data from PacBio circular consensus sequence data, particularly on the UC Davis FARM computing cluster. There are many steps involved in this process, all with their own documentation in different places, some of which is not very comprehensive. The purpose of this repository is to have all of the necessary information in one place with detailed instructions and solutions for problems. This documentation is split into three markdown files: one for using SLURM, a workflow manager used on the UC Davis FARM computing cluster; one for using PacBio Primrose as a method for obtaining methylation data, along with all of the other steps related to using Primrose; and one for using ccsmeth as an alternative method for obtaining methylation data.

All of the steps involved in this documentation are being used to obtain Strawberry methylation data for the Knapp (soon to be Feldmann) Lab at UC Davis. However, code provided in the documentation will be generalized for reproducibility.
